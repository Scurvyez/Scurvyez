### Hey! It's Steve. :)

## Hobbyist programmer by night, wildlife ecologist by day.
## Here are the projects I'm currently working on.

## Rimworld Mods...
- Steve's Animals
     - Adds a variety of new animals to the game with varied abilities and events.
     - Adds a new pawn graphics system to allow for animated textures on animals.
          - e.g. actual fire effetcs on some animals
          - ethereal effects on others
- Steve's Walls
     - Adds new walls to the game. Can be powered and will in turn glow, in any color you want.
          - use the games' color picker in 1.4 for any color glow you want
          - legacy wall versions from before 1.4 still included
- Fireflies
     - Adds glowing fireflies to the game. Spawn in small - large groups at night.
     - (reworking this mod at some point soon to be way more performance-friendly)
- Bones
     - Adds all 206 human bones to every humanlike pawn in the game.
          - all bones can be broken with new fracture hediffs
- Medieval Overhaul
     - (not my mod)
     - contributed code for rpg style lootable buildings which can be used on things like...
          - cabinets
          - bookshelves
          - treasure chests
          - bone piles, etc

## Peronal Projects...
